# NYC-SCHOOL-PERFORMANCE
Is there a statistically significant difference in the performance of Schools between the 5 Burroughs of NYC?
Using A/B testing and other describetive statistics avalible in Python, I compared the math scores across the five different bouroughs in New York.
There was a vast descrepencey betweens the Bronx and other New York Burroughs.
Upon completion of the project more in depth data is needed to explain why The Bronx is so far behind the other burroughs.
  - Avereage class size
  - Money per pupil
  - Avg teacher Salary
  - Score by individual schools (are there just a few schools draggins the average down)
