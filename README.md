# NYC-SCHOOL-PERFORMANCE
Is there a statistically significant difference in the performance of Schools between the 5 Burroughs of NYC?



# Background:
NYC has long struggles getting its school system up to par with state and national standards. This project serves as a perliminary look at the performance of schools in each Borough on the state math test. 

# Data:
The data was gathered from data.gov. With 420 total observations and no missing data. It includes information rangings from 3rd to 8th grade students running from 2006 to 2012. The orginal data set is linked below:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2006-2012-math-test-results-district-all-students

# Method:
Using A/B testing and other describetive statistics avalible in Python, I compared the math scores across the five different bouroughs in New York.

# Results and Recomendations:
There was a vast descrepencey betweens the Bronx and other New York Burroughs.
Upon completion of the project more in depth data is needed to explain why The Bronx is so far behind the other burroughs.
